# Tweetitude
Twitter sentiment analysis
# Dev Envionment set-up
Download Anaconda Python 3.7 [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual]
Download Apache Spark [https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html] (i think all you need to do is `pip install pyspark`)

Launch Anaconda and open the Jupyter Notebook App.
In the top right corner is a button for a `new terminal` click that then run `pip install pyspark`

Clone Tweetitude onto your local machine. 
Navigate to the Tweetitude git repository in Jupyter notebooks
Create a new file or work on an existing file from the Jupyter notebook file explorer.


To get the notebook's code into a .py file (if we need to when we migrate over to Google Cloud) use the `nbconvert` command (see docs below)
